# Weather
Chase coding exercise


- On App launch based on user location preferences, weather report is shown for user location
- user can search for weather report of city or state and result is shown
- if location permission is denied, last search result is cached and it shown when user opens the app next time
- file manager is used for cache because the data we are trying to save is very light and not most restricted one.
- image is cahced locally and making a service call to get the image to display
